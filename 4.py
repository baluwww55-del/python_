# SWAPPING :
a = 15 
b = 25 
# here a is 15 and b is 25
a = b
b = a 
# here we swapped a to b and b 
# means we interchanged the Assigned data  from a to b and b to a .
print(a)
# we can see the output tht a  assigned  value tht interchanged to b and b assigned value interchanged to a .

# TYPE CONVERSIONS :

# Ex what is type ?

# in printing type we can get to know which data type we used in code.
# simple code : 
name = " balaji "
print(type(name))

# so we here printed name and it showing which data type it is printing in output .

# TYPED CONVERSIONS :
#simple code of typed conversions :
age = 33 
my_float = 39.5 # we have to assign a perfect variable like my_float like that if we assign float it will be error.
age_float = float(age)
print(age_float)

# in this code we assigned some value  to variables to  age and float.
# and we converted age variable to float using float() function and assigned it to age_float variable.
